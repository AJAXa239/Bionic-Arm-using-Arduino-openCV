# Bionic-Arm-using-Arduino-openCV
A bionic arm that mimics hand movements using Arduino and OpenCV. OpenCV tracks gestures via a camera, and Arduino controls servos to replicate motions. Ideal for prosthetics, robotics, and education, it offers real-time gesture control and scalability. Future upgrades: wireless control, and machine learning. Great for exploring robotics and AI
